         A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk was born in Pretoria before immigrating to Canada, acquiring its citizenship. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the software company Zip2, that was later acquired by Compaq in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank, that later formed PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired U.S. citizenship, and eBay acquired PayPal. Using the money he made from the sale, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and became its chairman and later CEO. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging he falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla, stepped down as chairman, and paid a fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, and rebranded the service as X the following year. In January 2025, Musk was appointed director of the Department of Government Efficiency as a special government employee.
         Musk has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, affirming antisemitic and transphobic comments, and promoting conspiracy theories. His acquisition of Twitter was controversial due to large employee layoffs, an increase in hate speech, the spread of misinformation and disinformation on the service, and changes to various service features including verification. Musk has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of U.S. president Donald Trump. He became the largest donor in the 2024 United States presidential election, and is a supporter of far-right political parties, activists, and causes.
         Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[3][4] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[5][6] His mother, Maye (n√©e Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[7][8][9][a] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[15][16][17][18] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, a younger sister, Tosca, as well as four paternal half-siblings.[19][20][9][21] Musk was raised in the Anglican Church, in which he was baptized.[22][23]
         The Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[18] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[18] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".[24][25] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[3]
         After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[5][15] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[26] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a "paramilitary Lord of the Flies" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[27] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[28] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[28] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, "The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"[29]
